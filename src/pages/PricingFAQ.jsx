    questions: [
      {
        q: "What exactly is a 'credit' and how are they consumed?",
        a: "1 Credit = 1 psychographic profile analysis or update. Every time our AI analyzes a user's behavior to generate or refresh their psychological insights, it consumes 1 credit. This includes initial profiling from captured events, profile updates from new behavioral data, AI agent actions, and regeneration of insights. Basic event capture (page views, clicks) is completely free and unlimited."
      },
      {
        q: "Do page views, events, and integrations consume credits?",
        a: "No. Capturing events (page views, clicks, form interactions) is free and unlimited. AWS S3 exports, EventBridge streaming, and SES notifications are also included in your plan limits without consuming psychographic credits. Credits are only used for AI-powered analysis and agent actions."
      },
      {
        q: "How often do profiles get updated and consume credits?",
        a: "Our AI intelligently determines when to update profiles based on behavioral significance. Minor interactions may not trigger updates, while major actions (purchases, feature adoption, significant engagement patterns) will. Active users typically consume 3-8 credits per month, but this varies based on their activity level and complexity."
      },
      {
        q: "Can I control credit consumption and monitor usage?",
        a: "Yes. You can set analysis frequency (real-time, hourly, daily), configure minimum event thresholds for updates, pause analysis for specific user segments, and monitor real-time usage in your billing dashboard. You'll receive alerts at 80% and 95% of your monthly limit."
      },
      {
        q: "What happens with AI agents and credit usage?",
        a: "AI agents consume credits when they perform psychographic analysis or generate personalized content. Growth plans include up to 500 agent actions per month, while Pro plans have unlimited agent actions. Each agent action that requires psychographic processing counts as 1 credit."

    questions: [
      {
        q: "What's the difference between plan tiers in 2024?",
        a: "Developer (Free): 1,000 credits, core analytics, read-only AI agents, basic AWS integrations, community support. Growth ($99): 10,000 credits, full agents with 500 actions/month, Meta CAPI integration, automated AWS exports, email support. Pro ($499): 100,000 credits, unlimited agent actions, full ROI attribution (Meta + Google + GA4), advanced analytics, priority support + account manager. Enterprise: Custom deployment, unlimited everything, SLA guarantees."
      },
      {
        q: "What AWS integrations are included in each plan?",
        a: "Developer: 100 S3 exports, 1K EventBridge events, 100 SES emails monthly. Growth: Unlimited S3 exports, 100K EventBridge events, 1K SES emails. Pro: Unlimited S3 exports, 1M EventBridge events, 10K SES emails. All plans include real-time streaming capabilities and automated export scheduling."
      },
      {
        q: "How does ROI Attribution pricing work?",
        a: "Developer: View-only attribution reports. Growth: Full Meta CAPI integration with 5,000 conversion forwards/month. Pro: Complete attribution with Meta + Google Ads + GA4, supporting 50,000 conversion forwards/month. All forwarded conversions include psychological context and attribution modeling."
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if I exceed my monthly limits?",
        a: "Credits: $0.01-$0.02 per overage credit (lower rate for higher tiers). AWS usage: Pay-as-you-go AWS rates. Conversion forwards: $0.001 per conversion. You'll receive alerts before hitting limits, and all overages are detailed in your next invoice. No service interruptions."
      },
      {
        q: "Can I change plans anytime?",
        a: "Yes. Upgrades are immediate with prorated billing. Downgrades take effect at your next billing cycle. Unused credits don't carry over, but existing data and configurations remain accessible. Annual billing saves 15% on all paid plans."

They work autonomously to analyze patterns and take actions based on your configured rules."
      },
      {
        q: "What are agent action limits?",
        a: "Developer: Agents are read-only (insights only, no actions). Growth: 500 agent actions per month (actions like sending emails, updating profiles, creating segments). Pro: Unlimited agent actions and custom automation workflows. Enterprise: Dedicated agent compute resources and custom agents."
      },
      {
        q: "How does the new AI-assisted onboarding work?",
        a: "Our 2024 onboarding system is fully AI-driven and contextual. Instead of static tutorials, an AI assistant guides you through personalized tasks based on your setup, answers questions in real-time, and validates your progress. It adapts to your role, existing data, and goals to create a unique learning path."
      },
      {
        q: "What's included in 'Advanced Analytics'?",
        a: "Pro plans include: Cohort analysis with psychological segmentation, advanced attribution modeling, custom dashboard creation, exportable reports with psychological context, full API access for custom integrations, batch analytics for large datasets, and temporal trend analysis with confidence scoring."

    questions: [
      {
        q: "How do AWS integrations work and what's the setup process?",
        a: "knXw connects to your AWS account via IAM roles or access keys. S3 integration automatically exports psychographic data in JSON/CSV formats. EventBridge streams real-time events to your workflows. SES sends personalized emails based on psychological triggers. Setup is guided through our interface with validation testing."
      },
      {
        q: "What ad platforms support ROI attribution?",
        a: "Meta (Facebook/Instagram) via Conversions API, Google Ads via Enhanced Conversions, and Google Analytics 4 via Measurement Protocol. We send conversion events with psychological context, enabling ad platforms to optimize for users similar to your best converters. All integrations include test mode and error tracking."
      },
      {
        q: "How accurate is the psychographic analysis?",
        a: "Our AI models achieve 95%+ accuracy for core personality traits and emotional states, validated against established psychological frameworks (Big Five, DISC, emotional intelligence models). Confidence scores are provided for all analyses, and our 'Explainable AI' features show exactly how conclusions were reached."
      },
      {
        q: "What about data privacy and GDPR compliance?",
        a: "knXw is built privacy-first: automatic PII detection and hashing, granular consent management, one-click data exports and deletions, audit logs for all data operations, and dynamic compliance monitoring. Our Ethical AI Guardian agent proactively flags potential privacy issues and dark patterns."
      },
      {
        q: "Can I export my data and integrations?",
        a: "Yes. All your data (events, profiles, insights, configurations) can be exported in standard formats (JSON, CSV). Integration configurations can be exported as Infrastructure-as-Code templates. We provide migration assistance for Enterprise customers and maintain data portability standards."

      },
      {
        q: "How does multi-tenancy and workspace isolation work?",
        a: "Each workspace is completely isolated with its own database partition, API keys, integration credentials, and user access controls. Row-level security ensures no data leakage between tenants. Enterprise customers can have multiple workspaces with centralized billing and management."
      },
      {
        q: "What support levels are provided?",
        a: "Developer: Community forum and documentation. Growth: Email support with 24-hour response time plus AI-assisted onboarding.

    questions: [
      {
        q: "How long does implementation take in 2024?",
        a: "Basic setup takes 5-10 minutes (add JS snippet, verify tracking). First psychographic insights appear within 15-30 minutes of user activity. Full platform onboarding with AI assistance typically takes 2-3 hours across several sessions. Complex integrations (AWS, ad platforms) can be completed within a day."
      },
